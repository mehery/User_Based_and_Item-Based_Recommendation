# User_Based_and_Item-Based_Recommendation

## User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Recommendations are made based on user similarities.

We call it collaborative filtering, where we use the information of users with similar preferences to recommend a movie to one user based on the assumption that if one user likes a particular movie, another user with similar taste might like it as well.

Dataset Details

movieId: An unique ID for each movie

title: Title of the movie

genres: Genre of the movie (like is it drama, comedy, action or adventure)

userId: ID of the user giving the rating

movieId: The movie ID for which the rating has been given

rating: The rating given by the user

timestamp: The time at which the rating has been given

## Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Recommendations can be made based on item similarities.

For example, we recommend movies that have a similar liking pattern to a movie that has been watched.

We will try to obtain data based on the ratings that users give to movies and similar movies that exhibit similar liking patterns.
